              mutation rate on the interpitation of molecular clock theory.
              This was an attempt to show that neutral theory could be used to 
              help awnser the disconect of emperical results and molecular 
              clock theory, called ``overdispersed molecular clock''. They were
              able to help account for overdisperstion when mutation is low and 
              population is resnably low.}

              classic Wilke. Shows that as mutation increases rate of evolution 
              decreases, this is because his def of adaptation is related to 
              fixation. Interesting results all the same.}
